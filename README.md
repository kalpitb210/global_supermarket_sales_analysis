# Global-SuperStore-Sales-Analysis

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance for the Global Superstore. It visualizes key metrics such as sales, profit, profit margin, quantity, and sales by subcategory. Additionally, the dashboard  shows trends  in time to ship by order priority, as well as the top selling products and  profit contribution by product subcategory. Also, shows the sales by region.
